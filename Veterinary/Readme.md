- Facilitating the tracking of administered vaccines and providing veterinary doctors with the ability to create and manage appointments.

### üõ†Ô∏è**Technologies Used in the Project:**
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Maven (dependency management)
- Lombok (to reduce code repetition in Java)
